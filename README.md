adme-el
=======

A basic (pandoc) markdown plugin for emacs. Based on outline.el and org-mode. Best used as moutline-minor-mode in conjunction with a more featureful markdown mode. 

I am no longer actively maintaining this project but feel free to fork and continue development. [Org mode](http://orgmode.org/) has many outlining features from which moutline-mode could benefit.
